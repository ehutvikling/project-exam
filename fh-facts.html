                    <h2>Falcon Heavy</h2>
                    <p>
                        Falcon Heavy is the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two.
                        With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers,
                        crew, luggage and fuel--
                        Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle,
                        the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost. Falcon Heavy draws upon the proven heritage and reliability of Falcon 9.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Its first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate
                        more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft.
                        Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit.
                        Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space and restores the possibility of flying missions with crew to the
                        Moon or Mars.
                        Falcon Heavy missions will deliver large payloads to orbit inside a composite fairing, but the rocket can also carry the Dragon
                        spacecraft.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <h2>First Stage</h2>
                    <p>
                        Three cores make up the first stage of Falcon Heavy.
                        The side cores, or boosters, are connected at the base and at the top of the center core’s liquid oxygen tank.
                        The three cores, with a total of 27 Merlin engines, generate 22,819 kilonewtons (5.13 million pounds) of thrust at liftoff.
                        Shortly after liftoff the center core engines are throttled down. After the side cores separate,
                        the center core engines throttle back up to full thrust.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Boosters</h2>
                    <p>
                        Each of Falcon Heavy’s side cores, or boosters,
                        is equivalent to the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket with nine Merlin engines.
                        At liftoff, the boosters and the center core all operate at full thrust.
                        Shortly after liftoff, the center core engines are throttled down.
                        After the side cores separate, the center core engines throttle back up.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Three Nine-Engine Cores</h2>
                    <p>
                        Inside each of Falcon Heavy’s three cores is a cluster of nine Merlin engines.
                        These same engines power Falcon 9, enabling efficiencies that make Falcon Heavy
                        the most cost-effective heavy-lift launch vehicle in the world.
                        With a total of 27 first-stage engines,
                        Falcon Heavy has engine-out capability that no other launch vehicle
                        can match—under most payload scenarios, it can sustain more than one
                        unplanned engine shutdown at any point in flight and still successfully complete its mission.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <h2>Second Stage</h2>
                    <p>
                        Falcon Heavy draws upon Falcon 9’s proven design,
                        which minimizes stage separation events and maximizes reliability.
                        The second-stage Merlin engine, identical to its counterpart on Falcon 9,
                        delivers the rocket’s payload to orbit after the main engines cut off and the first-stage cores separate.
                        The engine can be restarted multiple times to place payloads into a variety of orbits including low Earth,
                        geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO) and geosynchronous orbit (GSO).
                    </p>

                    <h2>The World's Most Powerful Rocket</h2>
                    <p>
                        With more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff,
                        Falcon Heavy is the most capable rocket flying.
                        By comparison, the liftoff thrust of the Falcon Heavy equals approximately
                        eighteen 747 aircraft at full power.
                        Below is a comparison chart of the world’s heavy lift vehicles,
                        based on historical launch data.
                        Falcon Heavy can lift the equivalent of a fully loaded 737 jetliner--complete with passengers, luggage and fuel--to orbit.
                        Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit than Falcon Heavy.

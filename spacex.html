                        In 2001, Musk conceptualized "Mars Oasis", a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse containing seeds with dehydrated gel on
                        Mars to grow plants on Martian soil, "so this would be the furthest that life's ever traveled" in an attempt to regain
                        public interest in space exploration and increase the budget of NASA. But Musk realized that even with a much larger space budget,
                        travel to Mars would be prohibitively expensive without a fundamental breakthrough in rocket technology.
                        In October 2001, Musk travelled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell (an aerospace supplies fixer), and Adeo Ressi (his best friend from
                        college), to buy refurbished ICBMs (Dnepr) that could send the envisioned payloads into space.

                    <p>
                        Musk has stated that one of his goals is to improve the cost and reliability of access to space, ultimately by a factor of ten. In 2004
                        the company plans called for "development of a heavy lift product and even a super-heavy, if there is customer demand",
                        with each size increase resulting in a significant decrease in cost per pound to orbit. Musk said: "I believe $500 per pound ($1,100/kg)
                        or less is very achievable."

                        A major goal of SpaceX has been to develop a rapidly reusable launch system. As of March 2013, including a test program of the
                        low-altitude, low-speed Grasshopper vertical takeoff, vertical landing (VTVL) technology demonstrator rocket, and a high-altitude,
                        high-speed Falcon 9 post-mission booster return test campaign where—beginning in mid-2013, with the sixth overall flight of Falcon
                        9—every first stage will be instrumented and equipped as a controlled descent test vehicle to accomplish
                        propulsive-return over-water tests. SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell said at the Singapore Satellite Industry Forum in summer 2013 "If we get
                        this [reusable technology] right, and we’re trying very hard to get this right, we’re looking at
                        launches to be in the US$5 to 7 million range, which would really change things dramatically."

                        Musk stated in a 2011 interview that he hopes to send humans to Mars' surface within 10–20 years. In 2010, Musk's calculations convinced
                        him that the colonization of Mars was possible. In June 2013, Musk used the descriptor "Mars Colonial Transporter"
                        (only later changed to "Interplanetary Transport System") to refer to the privately funded development project to design and build a
                        spaceflight system of rocket engines, launch vehicles and space capsules to transport humans to Mars
                        and return to Earth. In March 2014, COO Gwynne Shotwell said that once the Falcon Heavy and Dragon 2 crew version are flying, the focus
                        for the company engineering team will be on developing the technology to support the transport
                        infrastructure necessary for Mars missions.

                    <h2>Tesla Roadster</h2>
                    <p>
                        Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster is an electric sports car that served as
                        the dummy payload for the February 2018 Falcon Heavy test flight and became an artificial satellite of the Sun.
                        "Starman", a mannequin dressed in a spacesuit, occupies the driver's seat.
                        The car and rocket are products of Tesla and SpaceX, respectively,
                        both companies founded by Elon Musk.
                        The 2008-model Roadster was previously used by Musk for commuting to work and is the only production car in space.
                        The car, mounted on the rocket's second stage,
                        acquired enough velocity to escape Earth's gravity
                        and enter an elliptical heliocentric orbit crossing the orbit of Mars.
                        The orbit reaches a maximum distance from the Sun at aphelion of 1.66 astronomical units.
                        During the early portion of the voyage outside the Earth's atmosphere,
                        live video was transmitted back to the mission control center and live-streamed for slightly over four hours.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <h2>Trajectory</h2>
                    <p>
                        The US Office of Commercial Space Transportation issued the test flight's launch license on February 2, 2018.
                        The rocket lifted off from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center at 15:45 EST (20:45 UTC) on February 6.
                        The upper stage supporting the car was initially placed in an Earth parking orbit.
                        It spent six hours coasting through the Van Allen radiation belts,
                        thereby demonstrating a new capability requested by
                        the U.S. Air Force for direct insertion of heavy intelligence satellites into geostationary orbit.
                        Then, the upper stage performed a second boost to reach the desired escape trajectory.
                        The launch was live streamed, and video feeds from space showed the Roadster at various angles,
                        with Earth in the background, thanks to cameras placed inside and outside the car,
                        on booms attached to the vehicle's custom adaptor atop the upper stage.
                        Musk had estimated the car's battery would last over 12 hours,
                        but the live stream ran for just over four hours, thus ending before the final boost out of Earth orbit.
                        The images were released by SpaceX into the public domain on their Flickr account.
                    </p>
                    <p>Following the launch, the rocket stage carrying the car was given the Satellite Catalog Number 43205, named "TESLA ROADSTER/FALCON 9H",
                        along with the COSPAR designation 2018-017A.
                        The JPL Horizons system publishes solutions for the trajectory as target body "-143205".
                        The Roadster is in a heliocentric orbit that crosses the orbit of Mars and reaches a distance of 1.66 au from the Sun.
                        With an inclination of roughly 1 degree to the ecliptic plane, compared to Mars' 1.85° inclination,
                        this trajectory by design cannot intercept Mars, so the car will neither fly by Mars nor enter an orbit around Mars.
                        This was the second object launched by SpaceX to leave Earth orbit,
                        after the DSCOVR mission to the Earth–Sun L1 Lagrangian point.
                        Nine months after launch, the Tesla had travelled beyond the orbit of Mars, reaching aphelion at 12:48 UTC on November 9, 2018,
                        at a distance of 248,892,559 km (1.664 au) from the Sun.
                        The maximum speed of the car relative to the Sun will be 121,005 km/h (75,189 mph) at perihelion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even if the rocket had targeted an actual Mars transfer orbit,
                        the car could not have been placed into orbit around Mars,
                        because the upper stage that carries it is not equipped with the necessary propellant, maneuvering, and communications capabilities.
                        This flight simply demonstrated that Falcon Heavy is capable of launching significant payloads towards Mars in potential future
                        missions.

                    <h2>Cultural impact</h2>
                    <p>
                        The car in space quickly became a topic for Internet memes.
                        Western Australia Police distributed a picture of a radar gun aimed at the Roadster whilst above Australia.
                        Škoda produced a parody video of a Škoda Superb being driven to Mars (a village in central France).
                        An attempt was made by Donut Media to launch a Hot Wheels-sized Tesla Model X to the stratosphere using a weather balloon.
                        ToSky, a Siberian start-up, sent a scale model of a Soviet-era Lada
                        carrying a mannequin of Roscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin to an altitude of 20 km to gather test data for the design of stratostats.
                        Some news reports observed a similarity between the real pictures of a car orbiting
                        the Earth and the title sequence of the 1981 animation film Heavy Metal,
                        where a space traveler lands on Earth in a two-seater Chevrolet Corvette convertible.
                        The SpaceX launch live stream reached over 2.3 million concurrent viewers on YouTube,
                        which made it the second most watched live event on the platform,
                        behind another space-related event: Felix Baumgartner's jump from the stratosphere in 2012.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The choice of the Roadster as a dummy payload was variously interpreted as a shrewd marketing move for Tesla, a work of art, or a
                        contribution to space debris.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <h2>Orbit tracking</h2>
                    <p>
                        The car and the upper stage were passivated by intentionally removing remaining chemical and electrical energy,
                        at which point they ceased transmitting telemetry.
                        Based on optical observations made using a robotic telescope at
                        the Warrumbungle Observatory, Dubbo, Australia and refinement of the orbit,
                        a close re-encounter with Earth (originally predicted for 2073) is not possible.
                        In October 2020, the car will make its closest approach to Mars,
                        about 6.9 million kilometres (4.3 million miles) away,
                        well outside the planet's gravitational sphere of influence.
                        The Virtual Telescope Project observed the Tesla two days after its launch,
                        where it had a magnitude of 15.5, comparable to Pluto's moon Charon.
                        The Roadster was automatically spotted and logged by
                        the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope operated by the University of Hawaii.
                        The car was observed by the Deimos Sky Survey (DeSS)
                        at a distance of 720,000 km (450,000 mi) with a flashing effect suggesting spinning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through measuring changes in apparent brightness of the object,
                        astronomers have determined that the Roadster is rotating with a period of 4.7589 ± 0.0060 minutes (i.e. 4 minutes, 46 seconds).
                        By February 11, 2018, astrometry measurements from 241 independent observations had been collated,
                        refining the positions to within one-tenth of an arcsecond and published by the SeeSat-L mailing list,
                        a group of amateur satellite spotters—more accurate than for most observations of objects in space.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Future predictions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Simulations over a 3-million-year timespan found a probability of the Roadster colliding with Earth at approximately 6%,
                        or with Venus at approximately 2.5%.
                        These probabilities of collision are similar to those of other near-Earth objects.
                        The half-life for the tested orbits was calculated as approximately 20 million years,
                        but with trajectories varying significantly following a close approach to the Earth–Moon system in 2091.
                        Musk had originally speculated that the car could drift in space for a billion years.
                        According to chemist William Carroll, solar radiation, cosmic radiation,
                        and micrometeoroid impacts will structurally damage the car over time.
                        Radiation will eventually break down any material with carbon–carbon bonds,
                        including carbon fiber parts.
                        Tires, paint, plastic and leather might last only about a year,
                        while carbon fiber parts will last considerably longer.
                        Eventually, only the aluminum frame, inert metals, and glass not shattered by meteoroids will remain.
